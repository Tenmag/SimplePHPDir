# SimplePHPDir
Simple PHP directory list

---

List files and subdirectories in the current "folder".
This is a non-recursive version (because of array's resource consumption).

### Features:

- Current folder name in title
- Distinguish files and folders (color and trailing dash)
- Show folders first
- Show sizes of files in human readable format
- Don't show inode size of "folders"
- Don't show (exclude) special files, like ".", "..", "index.php"
